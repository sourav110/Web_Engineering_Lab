                    <h3>The Team</h3>
                    <p>Germany...4 times world champion. <br>
                       When it was 2006 I was just in class six, didn't understand too much.
                       But I like to watch the running, chasing & dribbling of Christiano Ronaldo.
                       That's why I have a soft corner for Portugal.But not actually happend anything to fully
                       support them.That time I came to know about Nani, Pepe, Contaro..sorry it was 2010.
                       Same thing began to happen. Kaka the player I started liking,but dont like Brazil too
                       much as to be needed.But after watching Germany Players I came to know about 
                       Bastian Schweinstiger,after then Miroslav Klose, Mesut Ozil. <br>
                       
                       That's the begining.... <br>
                       Now I'm a supporter of Germany !!!
